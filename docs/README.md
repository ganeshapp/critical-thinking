# A guide to critical thinking

Critical thinking is the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgement.

# Why learn Critical Thinking? 

## How to think, not what to think

Critical thinking teaches you how to think, not what to think. This is important in a world where everyone wants to tell you what to think, believe, feel, do etc.

## Detect Lies

If we lived in a world where everyone was 100% honest, and fully committed to speaking only the absolute truth, we probably wouldn’t need to screen information and be as skeptical. The reality is however, we live in a world of:
* Alternative facts
* Fake news
* Manipulative advertising
* Propaganda
* Scams
* Mass delusions etc.

Critical thinking improves your bullshit detector, stops you from being gullible and naïve, and makes it easy for you to sort fact from fiction, truth from lies, reality from fantasy.

## Critical thinking makes you smarter

Critical thinking improves your logic, reasoning, decision making, problem solving and analytical skills. In a nutshell: It makes you smarter.
